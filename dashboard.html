            <h3>🎯 Personalized Suggestions for Next Week</h3>
            <ul class="suggestion-list">
                <li>
                    Based on the **Sleep Quality** data, try to set a firm bedtime goal of **11:00 PM** to target 7+ hours of sleep, especially on weeknights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since **Exercise** significantly boosted your mood, we suggest scheduling 3 guaranteed exercise times: **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning.**
                </li>
                <li>
                    To combat the high frequency of **Work/Stress** as a mood factor, implement a **10-minute mindful break** every two hours during your workday.
